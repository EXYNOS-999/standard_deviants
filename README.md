# neuromatch-project

Neuromatch Academy 2020 project using Steinmetz et al (2019) data: electrophysiology from multiple regions of mouse brain during 2AFC task.

The goal of this project is to investigate relationships between attentional regions of the brain and regions of the sensory processing hierarchy. This analysis will reveal the role of attention or engagement in modulating neuronal responses in disparate brain regions involved in decision making and perception.
